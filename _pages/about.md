# Videography

I‚Äôm passionate about videography‚Äîa hobby I‚Äôve recently picked up and really enjoy. I‚Äôve been learning how to film interviews, shoot different types of scenes, and capture subjects from creative angles. It‚Äôs exciting to tell stories through video, and I‚Äôm always looking to improve my skills.
